Web app for editing Tesseract OCR box files, using the [leaflet mapping library](http://leafletjs.com) and [leaflet.draw](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.draw).
Supports simple character-by-character box editing and WordStr format.
The box file format is detected automatically at upload.

### How to use
Upload an image and its corresponding box file.
Edit each box's info by typing the characters visible inside the box into the `Text` field.
Adjust a box's bounds using the `Left`, `Bottom`, `Right`, and `Top` fields.
Add new boxes by drawing them with the `Rectangle` tool.
Delete the selected box by clicking on the `Trash` icon.

Press the `Return` key after editing to commit and move to the next box.
Use the `Previous` and `Next` buttons to navigate boxes.
Keyboard shortcuts are available to navigate forward `control + shift + down` and backward `control + shift + up`.

Currently, the app does not work properly if no box file is uploaded.
